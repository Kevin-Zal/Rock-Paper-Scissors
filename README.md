# Rock-Paper-Scissors
<Short description>
This program plays a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with the user.  It is compatable
with Linux-based systems.

<Interactions, UI, error cases>
The program begins by prompting the user to press a '1' for Rock, '2' for Paper, or
'3' for Scissors on the keyboard.  The user interface recognizes 3 forms of entry:
('1', 'r', or 'R') for Rock, ('2', 'p', or 'P') for Paper, or ('3', 's', or 'S') for
Scissors.  If the user enters anything other than the aboce choices or the spacebar,
it will reprompt the user.  The program then displays the player's choice and its
choice, and informs the player of the result.  It then displays the score.  For the
first 7 rounds the program will play randomly.  However, after the first 7 rounds
the program will start to play against the user's past trends.
